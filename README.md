The "airsheet" project features interactive drawing tools and a Flappy Bird game controlled via hand gestures using Mediapipe, OpenCV, and Tkinter.

The main.py file serves as the entry point, providing a graphical user interface (GUI) for users to choose between different functionalities. Users can select from options such as drawing shapes and tools, drawing with different colors, and playing the Flappy Bird game.

The drawing functionalities are implemented using the Mediapipe library, enabling users to draw shapes and lines on a canvas using hand gestures captured by the webcam. The OpenCV library is utilized for image processing tasks such as hand landmark detection and drawing on frames.

Additionally, the repository includes two Python scripts: drawShapes.py and drawColors.py. These scripts implement the interactive drawing functionalities using OpenCV and Mediapipe, allowing users to draw shapes, lines, and colors using hand gestures.

Furthermore, the project includes a Flappy Bird game implemented in the flappyBirdGame directory. The game utilizes the Mediapipe library to detect hand gestures for controlling the bird's movement, providing an interactive gaming experience.
